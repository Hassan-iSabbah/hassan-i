                <p>The process of cyphering something means to encode a message so it remains confidential. Obfuscation is the process of making a message undreadable.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Tower of babel(obfuscation)</h2>
                <p>Effortlessly transforms english into 26 languages to prevent and non-programmer from attempting to read the message.
                Requires all text to be transformed into ordinal values and then solved.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h2>Anagram Cypher.</h2><p>
                    Dog and God are anagrams(both words share the exact same letters and length).<br>
                    Hacker sees: I love dog.
                    How will the hacker know if the original message was "i love dog" or if it was "i love god"? 
                    Because the hackers dont know for certain, they can only guess. This allows us to anagram a few words while decrypters second guess every single word.

                <h2>Cypher Automatic.</h2>
                <p>Uses a variety of ciphers to throw off any bruteforce attack, even data analytics.</p><br>
                <h2>Albertis Disk Modified</h2><p>Includes all letters in arrays.
                    Pros: beats frequency analysis.
                    Cons:Brute force???
