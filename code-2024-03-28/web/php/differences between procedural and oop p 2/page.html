THE MVC MODEL<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a brown haired boy, slouching on a chair, with horrible posture, clutching at his xbox-360 CONTROLLER. The controller is connected to the xbox 360 MODEL. The console displays the video game, minecraft on his huge flatscreen. What a VIEW!<br/>
<br/>
If you guessed by now, the controller will manage user input, such as queries to the database.<br/>
The Model will connect to the database, query it and then finally, the view will display everything to a page.</span></body></html>
