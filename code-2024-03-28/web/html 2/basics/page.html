<title>basics</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 15pt">The html structure is a small language about one simple question: WHERE. This requires super organisation and a little bit of &quot;OCD&quot;. If you have two pens in your house lying in random places or if you can never find your keys, this is because each item you own does not have a time allocated where you have decided where it belongs. The keys belong in the bookshelf, on the hanger. The pens go inside on the pencil case. <br/>
<span style="font-family: Century">So now when you wake up and youre super tired... where are my keys? They are in my house, in my living room, on my single bookcase facing my bedroom, on the second shelf from the top, on the right side, hanging from a hook. <br/>
in this example the house would be the &quot;first parent&quot;, the living room the &quot;child&quot;, the single bookcase the &quot;grandchild&quot;. the second shelf from the top being the &quot;great-grandchild&quot; of the house. I will coin this the GENERATION analogy.<br/>
</span><span style="font-family: Century">Bear with me, it is confusing at first but we will get the full picture once we look at the code.</span><br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 15pt">Every &quot;generation&quot; can bear children or have siblings: the living room(child) can have a siblingOne(toilet) and siblingTwo(kitchen). </span><br/>

<div style="text-align: right">The FIRST GENERATION IS CALLED HTML. when a baby is born we give it a name and wrap it in <span style="font-size: 15pt">Blankets</span>. Same thing with coding, when we declare(birth) an Element aka &quot;BOX/PLACEHOLDER/DIRECTORY/PATH&quot; we give it a (tag)name and wrap it in <span style="font-size: 15pt">Brackets &lt;&gt;<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><br/>
&lt;mrAdams&gt;<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;baby1&gt;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;baby2&gt;</li>
</ul>
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">&lt;mrsAdams&gt;</span><br/>
<br/>
We use indentation(tabSpace) to indicate that baby 1 is child of mrAdams. mrAdams is more important that mrsAdams just like the breadwinner of the family, is a man(opening tag). The families value will depend apon the OPENING TAG.<br/>
